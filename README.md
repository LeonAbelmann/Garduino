# Garduino
Arduino program running set of 12V garden lights, includes change of light pattern when PIR sensors are activated and adapts to duration of night.
Layout of controller and location of lights in Garduino.pdf (print of Qelectrotech Garduino.qet)
Code is very specific to set of lights in my particular case, but might serve as inspiration.
